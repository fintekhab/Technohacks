# Titanic Data Analysis
This project is used to analyse the summary statistics of the Titanic Dataset. 

## Data Loading and Cleaning
The dataset is in the form of a CSV file. The dataset is imported using Pandas. 
The missing values are checked and the columns that aren't necessary for further evaluation are dropped.

## Summary Statistics
The dataset is cleaned and only essential values are retained. Further, we compute the summary statitics of the 'Fare' column. 
Visualisation is also used to plot the frequency of 'Fare' values and the mean, median, and mode values using a histogram plot. 

## Requirements
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
